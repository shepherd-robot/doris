# DORIS
DORIS: Dataset for herding and predator detection with the use of robots

## üêë Dataset for Precision Livestock Farming and Predator Detection  

Precision livestock farming leverages new technologies to enhance farm efficiency, particularly in operations with low profit margins. Unlike agriculture, extensive livestock farming requires continuous supervision, making technological advancements slower in this field. Additionally, modern sustainability efforts emphasize biodiversity conservation and reducing the carbon footprint, promoting sustainable animal husbandry practices.  

Small livestock farms, often located in remote areas with challenging generational replacement, can greatly benefit from robotics and intelligent systems. These technologies can assist farmers in daily tasks, such as monitoring flocks of sheep and detecting potential predators like wolves. By identifying threats in real time, farmers can take proactive measures, such as relocating the herd to safer pastures.  

This repository provides a **dataset** containing images and videos to facilitate the detection, classification, and analysis of sheep flocks and their natural predator, the wolf. The dataset includes:  

- **Videos of sheep flocks** captured in various locations, under different lighting conditions, and featuring different sheep breeds.  
- **Images of wolves** in natural environments, which are typically underrepresented in standard computer vision datasets.  
- **Data captured with quadruped robot cameras**, enabling research on animal behavior in the presence of robotic systems.  

### üì• Dataset Access  

Due to its size, the dataset is available across three Zenodo repositories:  

üìå **Sheep images**: [Zenodo - 11313800](https://zenodo.org/records/11313800)  
üìå **Images of wolves, humans, and depth maps for simulation**: [Zenodo - 11313966](https://zenodo.org/records/11313966)  
üìå **YOLO annotations**: [Zenodo - 11313165](https://zenodo.org/records/11313165)
